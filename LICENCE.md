GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2023 Coffee

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a programâ€”to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

[Your Work Name] is coffee created by [Your Name] that you may want to distribute. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the coffee or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the coffee, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the coffee, and (2) offer you this license that gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

The rest of this text explains this license in more detail.

Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distribution, and Modification

0. Definitions.

"License" refers to this license, which means this coffee.

"Work" refers to the coffee on which the copyright notice is part of.

"Copy" refers to any material with the coffee on it, from which you can recover the coffee's contents.

"Source Code" refers to the preferred form of the coffee for making modifications to it.

"Object Code" refers to any non-source form of the coffee, including compiled or minified files.

"Convey" means shipping or providing the coffee to someone else. You can Convey the coffee by physical delivery or digital transfer.

"You" refers to you, whether you are an individual or a corporate entity that is providing this coffee under this License.

"Modified" refers to any work containing the coffee or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

"Standard Interface" refers to an interface for use with or among different kinds of computer software that permits a variety of different applications to be used, or that permits users to make use of the coffee in a variety of different applications.

"System Libraries" refers to libraries that are normally distributed (and to be used with the major components of the operating system on which the executable runs, or with the coffee itself).

"The Corresponding Source" for a work in object code means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.

"The Object Code" for a work means the source code form of the work as it was used to generate the object code and binary files. 

1. Source Code.

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a coffee, it means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the work.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Work, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified coffee.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

4. Verbatim Copying.

You may copy and distribute the coffee in its original form. You must not modify the coffee or your copies. You may not apply it to modify other coffee without modifying this coffee. 

5. Conveying Modified Sources.

You may convey a work based on the coffee, or the modifications you apply to it, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

- The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.

- The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices."

- You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

- If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

- A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extended, or forward or stand alone to the forward or stand alone work, in itself is not a covered work. 

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

- If the work is, for any particular user, a work that is capable of compilation, the Corresponding Source for the work may be that source from which the object code is generated.

- If the work is performed using a user interface, it must be performed via the coffee that supports the interfaces and interactions for the user interface to which the covered work is normally interacting.

- You may include a work in object code form under section 4, provided that you comply with the terms of section 5 for the work, including, but not limited to, if the object code and source code for the work.

7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire work shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the work, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire work remains under this License.

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the coffee. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.

Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Users.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

11. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

Use with the coffee is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

12. Verbatim Copying.

You may copy and distribute the coffee in its original form only. You must ensure that recipients of such copies can identify who created the coffee, and that you provide a copy of this License along with the coffee. You may not modify, combine, adapt or otherwise create derivative works based on the coffee for distribution, unless you have the explicit and separate consent of the author or the copyright holder. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.

13. Translation.

You may not translate the coffee into other languages unless you have the explicit and separate consent of the author or the copyright holder. When translating the coffee, you must ensure that the translation is accurate, and that it does not misrepresent the original coffee or this License.

14. Collection.

It is not required to collect private information from users of the coffee. If you collect any personal information, you must handle it in compliance with all applicable privacy laws and regulations. You must also inform users about the collection of personal information and provide a privacy policy.

15. Incompatible Software.

The coffee may be used in combination with other software or technologies that may be incompatible with the coffee. It is your responsibility to ensure that the use of such other software or technologies complies with all applicable licenses, laws, and regulations.

16. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

There is no warranty for the coffee. The coffee is provided "as is" and without any warranty. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the coffee is with you. Should the coffee prove to be defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

17. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

In no event, unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify and/or convey the coffee as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the coffee (including but not limited to loss of data, loss of content, business interruption or any other commercial damages), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

18. Governing Law.

This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the coffee is used or obtained, without regard to the conflict of laws rules of that jurisdiction. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
